## Test driven development in Criterion

This repository is an example of TDD in criterion library. The function `reverse` reverses an integer number , mentioned in "reverse_number.c" file. The `main` function is in "main_reverse_number.c" file. Criterion tests are in "test_reverse_number.c" file. All are distinct modules.

Execute "run_reverse.sh" to run the `main` function. Execute "test_reverse.sh" to try criterion tests.
